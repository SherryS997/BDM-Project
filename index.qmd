Greetings! I am thrilled to welcome you to this space dedicated to my Business Data Management (BDM) Project. This endeavor has been a significant milestone in my academic journey at IIT Madras, where I delved into the intricate world of data science and decision-making.

#### Project Overview:

The BDM Capstone Project is an embodiment of independent research, challenging students to engage with real-world business scenarios. In my case, I collaborated with a Cafe to identify and address pressing issues through the lens of data science.

#### Project Stages and Achievements:

1. **Proposal (Score: 96):**
   In the initial stage, I presented a comprehensive 4-5 page write-up outlining the organization's background, the defined problem, my chosen problem-solving approach, and anticipated project outcomes. The remarkable score reflects the dedication and clarity invested in this crucial foundation.

2. **Mid-Term Submission (Score: 90):**
   Building on the accepted proposal, the mid-term submission involved an 8-10 page detailed report. I also shared a video interaction clip with the business owner/manager, supplemented by tangible evidence like pictures and field notes. The score of 90 reflects the commitment to thorough documentation and analysis.

3. **Final Report (Score: 92):**
   The final submission was an exhaustive 18-20 page report, providing an in-depth exploration of the entire project journey. From initial data collection to the interpretation of results, each stage was meticulously covered, resulting in a score of 92.

4. **Viva Voce (Score: 92):**
   The culmination of the project involved a concise yet comprehensive presentation, not exceeding 10 slides. This segment, carrying 20% weightage, was an opportunity to articulate the project's nuances and insights, earning a score of 92.
