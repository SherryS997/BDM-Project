The model’s demonstrated ability to closely predict actual sales trends indicates its reliability in capturing intricate sales patterns, thus providing valuable insights for informed decision-making in business strategies and demand forecasting.

## RFM Analysis Overview for Customer Segmentation

The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a powerful technique used to segment customers based on their transaction behaviours. To derive the RFM values, the following steps were undertaken:

1. **Recency (R-score)**: It denotes the time since the last transaction made by each customer. Customers with lower scores have more recent purchases. Ranging from 1 (least recent) to 4 (most recent).
2. **Frequency (F-score)**: It represents the total number of transactions made by each customer during the analysed period. A higher score implies more frequent purchases. Ranging from 1 (least frequent) to 4 (most frequent).
3. **Monetary (M-score)**: It indicates the total monetary value spent by each customer. A higher score signifies higher monetary contributions. Ranging from 1 (least monetary value) to 4 (most monetary value).

### Analysis of RFM Segmentation

![](../images/rfm%20head.png)

The RFM_Segment column combines the individual R, F, and M scores into a three-digit number (RFM) that segments customers based on their behaviours.

**High-Value Customers**: Customers with an RFM segment of 444 or similar (e.g., 434, 444) are high-value customers. They have made recent purchases (R-score = 4), frequent transactions (F-score = 4), and contribute significantly in terms of monetary value (M-score = 4).

**Loyal but Less Frequent Buyers**: Segments like 422, 213, or 243 represent customers who might not make purchases as frequently but contribute substantially in terms of monetary value. They are recent buyers (R-score = 4) who spend well (M-score = 4 or 3) but with moderate frequency (F-score = 1 or 2).

**Churned or Dormant Customers**: Customers with segments like 111 or 121 signify those who haven’t made purchases recently (R-score = 1) or spend less despite some frequency (F-score = 2 or 3).

![](../images/rfm_dark_single_row.png)

Understanding these segments assists the café in optimizing resource allocation. For instance, focusing on high-value customers for loyalty programs, devising strategies to increase the frequency of moderately active customers, and engaging in negotiations with the dormant ones for exclusive deals. This approach aligns with the café's limited resources, aiming to maximize customer engagement and revenue with targeted efforts.

## Analysis of Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

The optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation using K-means clustering was determined to be 3, employing the elbow technique. The clustering analysis was performed on the features ‘Item Price’ and ‘Quantity’.

The resulting clusters exhibited distinctive characteristics:

- **Cluster 1: Low Priced Items and Low Quantity Bought**: This cluster comprises customers who tend to purchase low-priced items in smaller quantities.
- **Cluster 2: High Priced Items and Low Quantity Bought**: Customers in this cluster show a preference for higher-priced items but make purchases in lower quantities.
- **Cluster 3: Low Priced Items and High Quantity Bought**: This cluster represents customers who consistently purchase low-priced items in larger quantities.

Upon analysis, an intriguing observation was made: there appeared to be no distinct cluster representing customers who purchase expensive items in high quantities. This absence suggests that within the dataset and based on the analysed features, customers who buy items in larger quantities tend to opt for lower-priced items.

![](../images/kmeans.png)

The elbow plot showcasing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters indicated a clear ‘elbow’ or point of inflection at 3 clusters, signifying that additional clusters beyond this point do not significantly improve the model’s explanatory power.

The K-means clustering scatter plot, using ‘Item Price’ and ‘Quantity’ as axes, demonstrates the segregation of customers into these distinct clusters. These clusters provide valuable insights into customers’ purchasing behaviours based on price and quantity, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and enhance product offerings to better meet the preferences and demands of different customer segments.
